            <h3>What is PTCL?</h3>
            <p>Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). PTCL is a cancer of the immune system that starts when a type of white blood cell called a <span class="semibold">T lymphocyte</span>, or <span class="semibold">T cell</span>, begins growing out of control.<sup>3,4</sup></p>
            <p>It is called “peripheral” because the cancer starts in T cells outside the bone marrow. These cells may be found in the spleen, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, skin, or lymph nodes.<sup>3</sup></p>
            <div class="box">
                <p>T cells are an important part of the body’s immune response to ﬁghting illness or infection.<sup>3</sup></p>

    <h3>How PTCL starts</h3>
    <p>PTCL starts when a change in the DNA of a normal T cell causes it to divide too quickly and grow out of control. This allows the fast-growing cancer cells to build up in the body and live longer than normal cells.<sup>3</sup></p>

        <p>DNA instructions coded inside the chromosomes of each 
            T cell control how it behaves.<sup>3,5</sup> DNA wraps around proteins 
            called <span class="semibold">histones</span> that give chromosomes their shape.<sup>6</sup> An 
            enzyme called <span class="semibold">HDAC</span> (histone deacetylase) can change the 
            way DNA wraps around the histones. This can affect how 
            cells divide and grow.<sup>3</sup></p>

    <h3>PTCL has many subtypes</h3>
    <p>You may know that PTCL has many subtypes.<sup>4</sup> Naming the subtypes helps doctors describe the different types of cancerous T cells and their location in the body. Your doctor may talk to you about your PTCL subtype.</p>
    <h3>Most PTCLs are aggressive</h3>
    <p>Most PTCLs are aggressive (fast-moving), and patients with PTCL are likely to experience <span class="semibold">relapse</span> (meaning that the disease returns) after they had first responded to a treatment. In some cases, patients with PTCL do not respond to treatment, and this is known as <span class="semibold">refractory</span> PTCL.<sup>3,6,7</sup> Although there is no standard approach to treating relapsed or refractory PTCL, a number of treatments are available.<sup>8</sup></p>
