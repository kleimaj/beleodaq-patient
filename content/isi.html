        <h5>What is BELEODAQ<sup>&reg;</sup>?</h5>
        <p>BELEODAQ (belinostat) is a prescription medicine used to treat people with a type of cancer called peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) that comes back or does not respond to previous treatment. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trial.</p>

        <h5>What Are the Possible Side Effects of BELEODAQ?</h5>
        <p>BELEODAQ may cause serious side effects, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Low Blood Cell Counts:</strong> Patients may experience low blood cell counts. Your doctor will do weekly blood tests to check your blood counts.
                <ul>
                    <li>Low platelet counts can cause unusual bleeding, such as nosebleeds, or abnormal bruising. Talk to your doctor right away if this happens.</li>
                    <li>Low red blood cell counts may make you feel weak, feel tired, and/or get tired easily. You may appear pale and be short of breath. Contact your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms following treatment with BELEODAQ.</li>
                    <li>Low white blood cell counts can cause you to get infections, which may be serious.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Serious Infections:</strong> People receiving BELEODAQ may develop serious infections that can sometimes lead to death. You should not receive BELEODAQ if you have an ongoing active infection. You may have a greater risk of life-threatening infections if you have had chemotherapy in the past. Tell your doctor right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms of an infection: fever, flu-like symptoms, cough, shortness of breath, burning with urination, muscle aches, or worsening skin problems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Liver Problems:</strong> BELEODAQ may cause liver problems, which can lead to death. Your doctor will do blood tests during your treatment with BELEODAQ to check for liver problems. Tell your doctor right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms of liver problems: yellowing of the skin or the white part of your eyes, dark urine, itching, or pain in the right upper stomach area.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS):</strong> BELEODAQ can cause the fast breakdown of certain types of cancer cells. This can lead to TLS. Your doctor will check you for TLS during treatment with BELEODAQ.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Nausea, Vomiting, and Diarrhea:</strong> These side effects are common with BELEODAQ and can sometimes be serious. Tell your doctor if you develop nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
            </li>
