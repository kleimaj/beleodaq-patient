            <p>Caregiving can be stressful and draining. Tapping family members, friends, neighbors, and coworkers to help with daily tasks, household chores, and social support can help you maintain the energy and strength to be a good caregiver. Here’s how to coordinate a team effort that eases your burden and meets your loved one’s needs.</p>
            <p>Talk to your loved ones. Start by talking with your loved one about what kind of help they need and what tasks or activities they’d like to keep doing if they can. For example, they might want to keep walking the dog or doing the laundry but lack the energy to vacuum or mow the lawn. It’s important to take your cues from the person you are caring for. Although needs may change over time, encouraging independence as much as possible can give your loved one a greater sense of control over their life.<sup>12</sup></p>
            <p class="label"><strong>Get organized.</strong> Once you know where help is needed, make a list of tasks that must be done each week. This may include<sup>12</sup></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Medical needs</strong> such as taking your loved one to doctor’s appointments and treatment sessions, filling prescriptions, and dealing with bills and insurance claims</li>
        <li><strong>Practical tasks</strong> such as grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, and childcare</li>
        <li><strong>Social support</strong> such as keeping family and friends informed and doing activities with your loved one</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Divide and conquer.</strong> Scan the list and put a star next to anything someone else could do. Think about who has the skills and time to help with errands, chores, or online tasks such as organizing meal deliveries, sharing updates, or gathering information you need. Then start asking for help or let someone you trust do the asking for you.<sup>13</sup></p>
    <p><strong>Plan ahead.</strong> When you know where treatment will be given, check how long it will take to get there, the best route to take, and where to park when you arrive. Ask how long the treatment session will last. Keep a bag packed with whatever your loved one will need during the infusion. Bring along something to do while you wait. Line up a few people who can take your loved one to therapy or doctor’s appointments on days you can’t do it.<sup>12</sup></p>
    <p><strong>Give yourself a break.</strong> Take time every day to do something for yourself. Even a short break can give you more energy to get through the day. There are lots of ways to rest, relax, or recharge.<sup>13</sup></p>
