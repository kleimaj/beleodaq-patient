    <div class="info-box hidden" id="info-3">
        <p>PTCL starts when a change in the DNA of a normal T cell causes it to divide too quickly and grow out of control.<sup>3</sup> BELEODAQ blocks the action of enzymes called HDACs that can affect how cells divide and grow. BELEODAQ causes a chemical change that can stop cancer cells from growing and cause them to die.<sup>1,3</sup> BELEODAQ is the only HDAC inhibitor FDA approved for relapsed or refractory PTCL.<sup>1,9</sup></p>
