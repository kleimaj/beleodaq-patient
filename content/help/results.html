    <p>The main goal of the clinical trial was to measure the <strong>overall response to treatment</strong>.<sup>1</sup> This is the total number of patients whose cancer shrinks (a partial response) or is undetectable (a complete response).<sup>6</sup></p>
    <h3 class="secondary">People with relapsed or refractory PTCL have shown a response to BELEODAQ </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 of 10 patients responded or had stable disease (their cancer didnâ€™t get worse)<sup>1,2,6,*</sup></li>
        <li>Patients who achieved a complete response had a longer-lasting response to BELEODAQ<sup>2</sup></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The median duration of response (DoR) was greater than 29 months<sup>2</sup></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p class="small"><sup>*</sup>The effect on overall survival (OS) is not known.
        Median is the middle value in a list of values arranged from low to high such that there is the same number of values above and below the middle value.</p>
    <h3 class="secondary">Talk to your doctor about the results of the study. Ask how patients like you responded to treatment with BELEODAQ.</h3>
