    <h2 class="primary">Is BELEODAQ right for you?</h2>
    <p>That’s a question to discuss with your doctor when you review your treatment options.</p>
    <h3 class="secondary">It may help to learn who took part in a clinical trial that studied BELEODAQ in 129 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL.<sup>2</sup></h3>
    <p class="label">The trial included patients aged 29 to 81.<sup>2</sup></p>
    <ul>
        <li>48% of patients were 65 years or older<sup>1</sup></li>
        <li>52% of patients were younger than 65 years<sup>1</sup></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Everyone in the study had tried other PTCL treatments that were no longer working.<sup>1,2</sup></p>
    <p>21% of patients had a stem cell transplant (SCT) before getting BELEODAQ, and 7.5% received an SCT after treatment with BELEODAQ.<sup>1,2</sup></p>

    <p>Please see the <a class="secondary-3 semibold">Important Safety Information</a> and <a class="secondary-3 semibold">Full Prescribing Information</a> to review the possible side effects of BELEODAQ.</p>
    <p>All patients received 30-minute infusions of BELEODAQ once a day for 5 days. Every 3 weeks, a new cycle of daily infusions on days 1 through 5, followed by 16 days off treatment, could be repeated.<sup>1</sup></p>
    <h3 class="secondary">BELEODAQ offers dosing that may give you time to do more with your day<sup>1</sup></h3>

        <li class="alt-bullet">With a 30-minute IV infusion on days 1 through 5 of a 3-week cycle, you’ll have time to fit additional activities that are important to you into your day.</li>
